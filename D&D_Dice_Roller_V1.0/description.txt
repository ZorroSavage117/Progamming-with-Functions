This app is for those who play Dungens & Dragons.

It is a dice roller, I know there are others out there that are better,
    and more refined. I made this as a final project for one of my College 
    classes, it took roughly 2 weeks to make.

It rolls the standered 7 dice that are used in D&D, I added another dice 
    roller that takes the users input for a dice that I did not include 
    in the main set. It also save all rolls in the app so you can go back
    and look at them, they are stored by date and the number of sides.
